## College Football Matchup Analyzer

This tool compares two FBS teams' season stats using data from the [CollegeFootballData API](https://collegefootballdata.com/), predicts a score based on offensive/defensive yardage, and visualizes a stat comparison using Plotly.

### Features

* Retrieves live team stats from the CollegeFootballData API
* Predicts scores based on total offensive and defensive yards
* Visualizes side-by-side stat comparisons using Plotly
* Command-line interface for interactive use
* Includes automated tests using Pytest

### How It Works

1. You input two FBS teams and a season year.
2. The app fetches season-long team stats from the API.
3. It calculates predicted scores using total yards gained and allowed.
4. A bar graph of offensive and defensive PPG is displayed using Plotly.
